# GitOps: Beyond Patterns and Principles
## By Joel "Jaykul" Bennett
## PowerShell & DevOps Global Summit 2024

The presentation, along with all my notes, is on [HuddledMasses.org/GitOps-Principles](https://HuddledMasses.org/GitOps-Principles), and a cache of the slides from the presentation is in the (PresentationFromPSHSummit24.pdf)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jaykul/GitOps-Principles/main/PresentationFromPSHSummit24.pdf].

However, the source (with all my notes) is in [slides.md](https://github.com/Jaykul/GitOps-Principles/blob/main/slides.md), and if you want to "build" the deck yourself, you need the custom theme I did from [Jaykul/GitOps-Principles/theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jaykul/GitOps-Principles/main/theme).
